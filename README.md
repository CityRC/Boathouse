## Incidents and damage
Maintenance issues and damage should be reported under <a href="../../issues">Issues</a>.

Each issue should only contain a single item of damage or maintenance. If you have multiple things to report, you must open multiple issues. Please include a thorough description of the problem and which equipment or boat the problem applies to.
